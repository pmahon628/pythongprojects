learning python! 

Small projects with Python.

For now - until there is a link - these games can be run by cloning the repo and running the files.  I have been using Python Launcher on my machine but you are free to run it however you see fit.

A. pong.py  - this is runnable code - instructions coming when game is finished.
  - link to play pong: (TBA)

B. snake.py - this game works fully - please use the W A S and D keys for up, left, down, and right movement.
  -  link to play snake (TBA)


Thanks!
